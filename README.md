Problem Statement
------------------
Rna Transcription
Write a program that, given a DNA strand, returns its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:

G -> C
C -> G
T -> A
A -> U
Setup Instruction
------------------
Install nodeJS from here(if not present in your machine) - https://nodejs.org/en/

Install jasmine-node using npm :-

$npm install -g jasmine-node

Create a new branch with your name and commit your <solution js> file and push your branch.

Making the Test Suite Pass
----------------------------
Execute the tests with:

$ jasmine-node .

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by changing xit to it.!
